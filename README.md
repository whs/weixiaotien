# WeiXiaoTien - a LLM evaluation

![Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8LR1_0yc64)

Siang Pure Oil had an advertisement in early 2000 in Wuxia style. It involves an old man and a young hero fighting
then an old lady appears to interrupt the fight by telling the old man is the hero's father. Then the two old people
start telling him his family tree which can get confusing. The narrator interrupts the dizzying hero by advertising
the oil saying that it could help with dizzyness.

I think the story is a good LLM test case! For example, "แม่นาง 14" is a job position, but some LLM do understand it as
real mother (adopted or biological) in family trees.

However, the advertising and its analysis are public for several years so that it is possible that it may end up in
one of the training data, including this repository.

## The test

The LLM should generate family tree. The output is defined as JSON Schema, which test the model's ability to follow
schema.

The correct relationship diagram is

| Character 1   | Relationship  | Character 2 |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| เว้ยเส้าเทียน | สหายรัก       | จางฟู่เหยิน |
| เว้ยเส้าเทียน | พ่อ           | พระเอก      |
| จางม่านจือ    | แม่           | พระเอก      |
| เส้าสี่เฉียน  | พบใกล้หนองน้ำ | พระเอก      |
| จางฟู่เหยิน   | เก็บมาเลี้ยง  | พระเอก      |

As for เซี๊ยะถงอี้, my interpretation differs from [Aquapatindra's interpretation](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=482218268541373&set=a.276875085742360).
I think "น้าสาวพี่แม่" is doubled as aunt is already means mother's older sister, but Aquapatindra believe that it should be
interpreted literally - เซี๊ยะถงอี้ is the aunt of จางม่านจือ's mother.

Some people and LLM also believe จางม่านจือ and จางฟู่เหยิน is also related by family name. Since the relationship is unclear
it is not charted.
